            Your mindset should be: How quickly can I make decision and how fast
            can I gain control of the ball

            The team with possession is attacking, if they are not in control of
            the ball it's not an attack but still defense.
          </p>
          <h3>1st man:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Make 2nd man’s job easier</li>
            <li>Make it hard on enemies on ball</li>
            <li>
              Don’t throw yourself at ball (don’t leave your 2nd man in 1v2)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>2nd man:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Create time for your 1st man to become 2nd man</li>
            <li>
              Should use things that bring you the advantage: Take time, Fake
              challenges, good low 50s…
            </li>
            <li>Don’t go if you don’t need to</li>
            <li>Cover teammates weak outcome</li>
          </ul>
          <p>1 should often be backboard (1st man or 2nd man?)</p>

            Works because people overextend on offence because they don’t want
            to play defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            You want to attack as quickly as possible, push the pace of the ball
            and make sure the last touch is perfect (take quick 1st touch).
          </p>
          <p>You can shoot if they are too close a lot.</p>
          <p>Clear it so it goes in the air.</p>
          <p>
            When countering you can demo last if it's 1v2 or pass teammate if
            available.
          </p>
          <p>When doing it go toward the net and not walls or corners.</p>

          <h3>1st man:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Beat their 1st man</li>

            <li>If 1st has 1 player to beat cover his strong</li>
            <li>
              If your 1st is attacking you must be there with him even on low
              boost (collect some pads, 24 is all you need) (doesn’t mean
              overcommit)

            </button>
          </p>
          <h3>Part of recovering and rotating is selecting pads:</h3>
          <p>That’s what makes you a fast player</p>
          <h3>Recovery’s:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recoveries are really important to get back as fast as possible
              but you should use as little/0 boost recovering.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should try to save as much boost recovering and defending as
              possible
            </li>
            <li>If you're close to supersonic speed feel free to use it.</li>
            <li>With saving the boost recovering you have boost for offense</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Rotations:</h3>
          <h4>1st man:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If opponents are dribbling /on the ground, go harass them to make
              it easy for the 2nd man.
            </li>
            <li>
              If they are in the air, it depends:
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you are fast enough rotate behind your 2nd man so that he
                  can challenge from better position, and you can cover behind
                  him.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you won’t be fast enough, challenge in the air so you make
                  it easy for your 2nd man.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>2nd man:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>If 1st has 2 players to beat cover his weak (50 / outcome)</li>
            <li>If 1st has 1 player to beat cover his strong</li>
            <li>
              If your 1st is attacking you must be there with him even on low

          <h3>Speed:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Try to always keep your momentum going / don’t break check</li>
            <li>
              If you miss a boost, go past it most of the time (depending how
              much momentum you have)
            </li>
            <li>
              How do you become fast: work on hitting the ball as fast as
              possible of the reads
            </li>
            <li>
              Every time it hits a surface try to hit it somewhere with
              intention as fast as possible (in freeplay)
            </li>
            <li>
              If you feel like you are out of control, that is good because you
              will learn to get that speed under control
            </li>
            <li>
              A lot of players do: Try to be supersonic -> break check -> try to
              go supersonic again
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Decision making:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not hesitate</li>
            <li>
              If you make a decision do that decision and learn. Even if it's
              wrong you will learn from it
            </li>
            <li>
              If you make the right decision and it’s a second late because you
              overthought it, it’s a wrong decision -> commit to your decision
              as soon as possible

            If you feel like you did the right challenge and you still lost it
            -> Think about a different angle to approach that challenge
          </p>
          <h3>Dive challenge:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Only dive challenge if you're confident it will benefit your team
            </li>
            <li>Don't do it too often</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Drive challenge:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Useful because you can challenge without jumping</li>
            <li>
              Drive challenge often happens when challenge needs to happen but
              you don't want to throw yourself out of the play -> intention is
              hit ball and head back
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Fake challenge:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Do it when you are in position of power</li>
            <li>You should cover your net when fake challenging</li>
            <li>
              I like to do it if I’m shadowing and opponent has good control of
              the ball
            </li>
            <li>
              If you force them to do something with fake – you are now in
              control
            </li>
            <li>Always cover your net when faking</li>
            <li>
              You can fake challenge when they are panicking it will force even
              more panic

          <p>Stick to fundamentals.</p>

            If you have an awkward challenge and your teammate has a less
            awkward challenge let him do it.

          <p>Cover your teammates weaknesses and enable his strengths.</p>

            You should mostly only be adapting to your opponents with your
            mechs.

            Example: they prejump you when you go for air dribble -> you go back
            down and not air dribble into them.

          <p>Mental is very important in this game.</p>
          <p>
            Tilting is an emotion and it's ok to tilt, you will 100% tilt if you
            are a competitive person.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should try to notice enemy’s mistakes and not your teammates.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you look for enemy’s -> you are looking for how to win</li>
            <li>
              If you look for teammates mistakes -> you will see how you are
              losing
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you already had a bad day don’t go and play ranked, don’t do that
            to yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you really want to go casual first, then decide what you want.
          </p>
          <p>You can make yourself play a certain number of games a day</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You realize you have to play let say 15 games a day so you can't
              tilt on game 6
            </li>
            <li>Over time your mental will get better</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your teammate is throwing the game on purpose, throw the game 2
            times as hard be petty so it helps your mental, it’s a mental
            refresh.
          </p>
          <p>Try to have fun -> you will become more creative</p>

            If there is nothing you can do, go to where you think the next play
            will be or do something productive (collect boost pads, get better
            position…)

          <p>Have intention:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Say I’m gonna go wall -> ceiling get reset -> get 1 touch on ball
              -> shoot
            </li>
            <li>Do/try to do that don’t switch up mid shot</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Break mechs down into small steps / drills</p>
          <p>Don’t just reset your shot if you mess up try to follow it up</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Think why you messed up, try to correct it next attempt</li>
            <li>Adapt to your mistakes in training and freeplay</li>
          </ul>
          <p>DO NOT QUICK CHAT TO TEAMMATE WHEN THEY ARE ON THE BALL</p>
